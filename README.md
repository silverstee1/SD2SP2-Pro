The inside PCB must be ordered in 1.2mm thickness. Surface finish must be ENIG at minimum.

The outside PCB must be ordered in 2.0mm thickness.

I recommened https://jlcpcb.com for PCB production.

***Occasionally when recieving the pcb's from JLCPCB the outside pcb may have a bump/not flush cut near the SP1 side when it was cut at the fab and might require sanding to smooth it out for a better fit.***

***Included is a stl cover in the 2.0 project folder that fits flush with the outside pcb***
